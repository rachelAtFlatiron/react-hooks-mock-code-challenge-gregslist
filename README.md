## Instructions

Welcome to gregslist, a community site for finding free items near you.

Your job will be to make our app work according to the user stories you will
find in the [Core Deliverables](#Core-Deliverables) section.

## Setup

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. In a new terminal, run `npm start`.

## Core Deliverables

As a user:

1. When the app starts, I can see all listings (you should need .map).
2. I can "favorite" and "unfavorite" a listing on the frontend by clicking the
   star icon (this requires state).
3. I can search for listings by their name (use .filter, similar to FilteredProjects from lecture).


## Advanced Deliverables

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure
> to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user:

1. I can sort the listings alphabetically by location.
2. I can create a new listing by submitting a form.
3. I can remove a listing from the page by clicking the trash can icon.
